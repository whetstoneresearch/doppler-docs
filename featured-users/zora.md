# Zora

### Description

Zora is an onchain social network, where every post is a "content coin".

### How it works

Users can visit Zora, browse, and explore content from other Creators. They are able to create their own content on the platform, similar to traditional web2 social media applications. When creating a post, each post gets it's own unique, fungible token, created with the help Doppler's smart contracts. Other users can then collect their favorite content, and the creators earn fee's when doing so.&#x20;

In addition to Content Coins, Zora profiles have Creator Coins associated with them. [Learn more here](https://x.com/zora/status/1936096447864488277).&#x20;

### Implementation details

Zora is using a custom implementation of Doppler that works with their existing smart contract protocol. View their codebase on GitHub here: [https://github.com/ourzora](https://github.com/ourzora)&#x20;
