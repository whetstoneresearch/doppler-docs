# Ohara

### Description

From prompt to onchain app, [Ohara](https://ohara.ai/apps) is the simplest way to generate apps on [Base](https://www.base.org/).

Save money and focus on what matters: your ideas.&#x20;

### How it works

Once users are happy with the applications Ohara generated via their prompts, they can publish it alongside the creation of an App Coin (via Doppler), subject to the following implementation details.

### Implementation details

* 10% of the total token supply :point\_right: publisher of an application on Ohara
  * Subject to linear vesting ("unlocks") over 12 months&#x20;
* 3% of the total token supply :point\_right: treasury of an application that gets "remixed" on Ohara
  * Ohara.ai has the notion or concept of "remixing" an application
    * This means that an application which was originally created (or prompted) by a specific user was essentially "forked"  often with slight changes. By default, Ohara gives 3% of the token supply of _remixed_ applications to the original application's creator.&#x20;
