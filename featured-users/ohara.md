# Ohara

### Description

From prompt to onchain app, [Ohara](https://ohara.ai/apps) is the simplest way to generate apps on [Base](https://www.base.org/).

Save money and focus on what matters: your ideas.&#x20;

### How it works

Once users are happy with the applications Ohara generated via their prompts, they can publish it alongside the creation of an App Coin (via Doppler), subject to the following implementation details.

### Implementation details

* 9% of the total token supply :point\_right: publisher of an application on Ohara
  * Subject to linear vesting ("unlocks") over 12 months&#x20;
* If an application gets "remixed" on Ohara, the publisher of the original app gets 3% and the publisher of the new app gets 6%, also vested over 12 months.
  * Ohara.ai has the notion or concept of "remixing" an application. This means that an application which was originally created (or prompted) by a specific user was essentially "forked", often with slight changes.
* Every time an app coin is traded through the Uniswap v3 pool, the app publisher also receives 0.45% of the traded amount.
