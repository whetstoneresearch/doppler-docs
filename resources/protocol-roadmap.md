# Protocol roadmap

\
Notably this does not include every designed or planned feature, improvement, nor integration. Rather it aims to provide directional insight to communities interested in building with Doppler so they can make more informed decisions about their own integration roadmaps. Additionally this serves as a vehicle by which teams can request other items they’d love to see prioritized.  _**It is entirely subject to change.**_



Up next:

* ~~Doppler Core~~ - [Read the Core release announcement](https://x.com/dopplerprotocol/status/1933169128166334882) :white\_check\_mark:
  * ~~Full support for Dutch Auction Dynamic Bonding Curves with Uniswap v4~~
    * ~~Start auctions at customizable, existing market prices~~&#x20;
* Doppler Optimized for Mainnet Ethereum (DOME)
* “Bring your own” network and protocol tokens to auction from other contracts&#x20;
* Explorers integrations
* Data visualization platforms integrations
* Treasury tool integrations&#x20;



Always ongoing:&#x20;

* Additional demo applications
* Additional application integrations
* Deployments to popular Layer-1's
* Deployments to popular Layer-2's
* Developer experience improvements

If you work on project and are interested in integrations or collaborations with Doppler, such as deploying to your protocol, please get in touch at [contact@whetstone.cc](mailto:contact@whetstone.cc) or to a team member directly.&#x20;

The [Doppler Airlock](https://docs.doppler.lol/how-it-works/airlock-and-modules) makes it seamless to integrate other downstream smart contract protocols that benefit the token issuance lifecycle and make these optionally available to developers. Some of these may include novel sybil resistance mechanisms that can reduce spam or MEV during the auction or initial issuance. A significant portion of the Doppler roadmap aims to provide a seamless, programmable experience for the initial distribution of assets, as well as their ongoing governance and long term alignment between ecosystem participants.



Future plans (not in any particular order):

* New novel auction dynamics
* Sybil resistance modules
* Airdrop protocol modules
* Lending protocol modules
* More flexible governance structures
* Customizable fee & MEV redistribution
