# Welcome



Doppler is an Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) based token launchpad & liquidity bootstrapping protocol. It utilizes a new onchain mechanism we call a 'Dutch Auction Dynamic Bonding Curve'&#x20;

Which enables you to easily...



{% stepper %}
{% step %}
### Create arbitrary assets

Memecoins, RWAs, any asset you can imagine, can be created on Doppler
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### Enter price discovery

Efficiently find the correct, market driven price for these assets
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### Bootstrap initial liquidity

Build liquidity around the initial price and establish a marketplace for the assets
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### Plug into a thriving ecosystem

Automatically connect your tokens & liquidity to the rich EVM DeFi & Uniswap ecosystems
{% endstep %}
{% endstepper %}

Token issuers and application developers no longer have to worry about the complicated, burdensome aspects of a token's lifecycle. From creation to issuance, price discovery to liquidity formation, distribution to ecosystem integrations - doppler enables you to focus on building compelling, unique applications & experiences; not designing auctions, becoming MEV infrastructure experts, or grinding for distribution.
