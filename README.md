# Welcome



Doppler is an Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) based token launchpad & liquidity bootstrapping protocol. It utilizes a new onchain mechanism we call a 'Dutch Auction Dynamic Bonding Curve'&#x20;

Which enables you to easily...



{% stepper %}
{% step %}
### Create arbitrary assets

Memecoins, RWAs, governance tokens, any arbitrary asset, can be created on Doppler
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### Enter price discovery

Efficiently find the correct market driven price for these assets
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### Bootstrap initial liquidity

Build liquidity around the initial price and establish a marketplace for the assets
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### Plug into a thriving ecosystem

Automatically connect your tokens & liquidity to the rich EVM DeFi & Uniswap ecosystems
{% endstep %}
{% endstepper %}

Token issuers and application developers no longer have to worry about the complicated, burdensome aspects of a token's lifecycle. From creation to issuance, price discovery to liquidity formation, distribution to ecosystem integrations - Doppler enables you to focus on building compelling, unique applications; not designing auctions, becoming MEV infrastructure experts, or grinding for distribution.

### Deployments

Doppler is currently deployed to Base, Unichain, and Ink, with others coming soon.&#x20;

[See the contract addresess](resources/contract-addresses.md), including testnet deployments to Arbitrum and Monad.&#x20;

### Get started

#### Demo app

Doppler has an open source demo application that targets Doppler v3.&#x20;

It is written in React, TypeScript and other familiar frameworks. The demo application is the easiest way to get familiar with what applications built ontop of the protocol look like.&#x20;

#### SDK

Doppler has an open source SDK that is written in TypeScript. It provides friendly and familiar interfaces for interacting with the onchain smart contracts. Additionally developers are able to interact with the smart contracts directly with their favorite toolchains. View the [SDK reference](broken-reference).
